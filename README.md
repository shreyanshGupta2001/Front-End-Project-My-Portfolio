# Front-End-Project-My-Portfolio

This is purely a front-end project done by me using the scripting Languages like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
This is a landing page of template #MeetMe provided by Colorlib, I wanted to test my skills of frontend and decided to recreate this template provided by Colorlib. 
Here all the links of the site from which I took the logos in already enclosed within the HTML file.

The images I used in the 'Our Projects' section are all taken from Walli 4K android application.
